##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Phishing_Legitimate_full.csv on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/monasahoo/phishing-website)
- **Features**: 49 numerical features extracted from URLs
- **Target**: `CLASS_LABEL`  
  - `1` â†’ Phishing  
  - `0` â†’ Legitimate

---

##  Model Training

- Models used:
  -  Random Forest
  -  XGBoost
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy comparison
  - Best model selected and saved as `phishing_model.pkl`
- Scaler saved for consistent inference

---

##  Inference

- Notebook: `infer_model.ipynb`
- Loads saved model and scaler
- Accepts new input (manual or CSV)
- Returns prediction: **Phishing ðŸš¨** or **Legitimate âœ…**

---

## Web App (Flask)

- File: `app.py`
- UI: `templates/index.html`
- Accepts all 49 features via form
- Displays prediction with styled result
- Includes link to Kaggle dataset for input reference
